# JSON Mapper

## Description

JSON Mapper is a simple macOS app to convert JSON data to [Object Mapper](https://github.com/Hearst-DD/ObjectMapper) models. Currently it supports only Swift language, but we have plans for other languages as well.

## Build requirments

* Xcode 8.1
* CocoaPods 1.1.0

## Inspiration

We have used cool [SwiftyJSONAccelerator](https://github.com/insanoid/SwiftyJSONAccelerator), but we found it not very convinient to adapt for our needs, so it was decided to develop and mantain our own tool.
